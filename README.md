# Ghostly-Ghosts
A little stupid thing I wanted to test out


Version 1.3:
  Okay now here's a REAL changelog:
    Added idle income
    Considering adding offline income. Maybe!
    Made things work good
    Buying the store item now actually gives you income which wasn't a bug I just didn't bother doing it until now
    Leaving the vacuum on costs cash, which you probably don't have a lot of. If only there was a way to automatically earn money..
    Gently kissed a ghost on the forehead.

Version 1.2:
  I think I added the footer here. These are all after the fact. Whoops!

Version 1.1:
  Fixed some layout issues, implemented some javascript stuff.

Version 1:
  Basically just setting things up. Not much to say.
